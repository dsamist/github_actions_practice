# github_actions_practice
This repository is created for my learning purpose on implementing a CI pipeline with Github actions and workflow.
This can be used by anyone who wants also to practice CI/CD implementation with github action. The main task I focused on was building your application and saving it to a container registry (in this case, docker hub).
